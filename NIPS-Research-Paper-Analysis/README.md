# NIPS-Research-Paper-Analysis
Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is one of the top machine learning conferences in the world. It covers topics ranging from deep learning and computer vision to cognitive science and reinforcement learning.

This dataset includes the title, authors, abstracts, and extracted text for all NIPS papers to date (ranging from the first 1987 conference to the current 2016 conference). I've extracted the paper text from the raw PDF files and are releasing that in CSV files.

Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is one of the top machine learning conferences in the world where groundbreaking work is published. In this Project, you will analyze a large collection of NIPS research papers from the past decade to discover the latest trends in machine learning. The techniques used here to handle large amounts of data can be applied to other text datasets as well.

Familiarity with Python and pandas is required to complete this Project, as well as experience with Natural Language Processing in Python (sklearn specifically).
